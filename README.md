# You ARE going to win!

Project for Python programming class (UNG)-
this project is meant to apply basic math functions to give you those winning lottery numbers!

The desire to create this useful gadget comes from a lot of wasted money. I've played, and I've lost when it comes to playing powerball. Anyone can win at a scratch off, your chances of winning something on a $1 scratch off is approximatley 1:4 depending on the game. When it comes to powerball your chances are 1:292,201,338 to hit the jackpot. Those are some slim odds. But, what if you could use Python to give you the upper hand on the odds? The ultimate goal for the code is to create a list of 6 numbers, 5 of which are you regular numbers, and the sixth is the powerball.

To get the ball rolling...

Code:
def you_gonna_win():
"""Returns repeated lottery numbers in a set of 6

>>>you_gonna_win(8, 10, 26, 27, 33)
"""
raw
    return max(set(lst), key=lst.count)
